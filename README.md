# Just Another Control Panel Engine
A control panel that lets you create your own panels and forms to reflect the data structure of your API.

⚠ The project is currently in the *very* early stages of development, so just a handful of features are implemented. ⚠

### Ideas / Goals
* Configure all your panels, pages, API calls and more on the go.
	* Drag and drop everything that fits.
* Allow users as much customization as possible.
	* Create a multitude of available elements — like buttons, input fields, image containers, graphs, tables and more.
* Allow usage without a back-end server by storing the config in the browser for people who do not want an additional server running.
* Support many different API "types" like *JSON*, *GraphQL*, and maybe even *WebHooks*.
* Make it look pretty.

### Usage
Just clone this repository and run `yarn install` to install all the needed dependencies.

For now, this is just a `create-react-app` project, so you can use default commands:

* `yarn start` — Start the development server.
* `yarn build` — Create a production build.

Some other commands:

* `yarn lint` — Lint js files (ESLint)
